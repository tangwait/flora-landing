# flora-landing

This was a very challenging project.

I binged this for a few days and I definitely know a lot more about HTML and CSS than I did before.

Main takeaways from this project:
adding/editing embedded images and videos
flexbox and flex properties
proper usage of divs/containers
adding and embedding links
formatting photos/containers/links
